## Touch Typist's Completion Caddy

Adds control over what characters and for which prefixes, late to the game auto-popup completion
will perform a completion or quietly f-off and leave your already typed text as you intended it.

Prompted by auto-popup completions in Kotlin triggering on `var`, `val` or `null` and completing
on a typed space to insert some random function starting with `var`, `val` or `null` prefix. As
a result triggering a severe bout of Tourette's.
