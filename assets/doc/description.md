Adds option to disable auto-popup completions on a space to leave your already typed text as you
intended.

Configure it in Editor > General > Code Completion settings (Preferences on OS X). Disable for
all languages or only for languages in a configurable list.

If you want to insert a suggestion for space disabled auto-pop then either use TAB or ENTER or
**manually change the selected suggestion** before using SPACE to insert it.

Prompted by delayed auto-popup completions in Kotlin after typing `var`, `val` or `null`
followed by a space, inserting some random function, triggering a severe bout of Tourette's as a
result.
