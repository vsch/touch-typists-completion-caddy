<p>Adds option to disable auto-popup completions on a space to leave your already typed text as you
intended it.</p>
<p>Configure it in Editor &gt; General &gt; Code Completion settings (Preferences on OS X). Disable for
all languages or only for languages in a configurable list.</p>
<p>If you want to insert a suggestion for space disabled auto-pop then either use TAB or ENTER or
<strong>manually change the selected suggestion</strong> before using SPACE to insert it.</p>
<p>Prompted by delayed auto-popup completions in Kotlin after typing <code>var</code>, <code>val</code> or <code>null</code>
followed by a space, inserting some random function, triggering a severe bout of Tourette&rsquo;s as a
result.</p>
